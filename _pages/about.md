  I am a programmer, an innovator, an **entrepeneur**. I excel at creativity; designing and building functional applications. I graduated with a **Computer Programming Diploma** from ICT Seneca. There I learned fundamentals in full stack development, database management and object-oriented programming. I've never had a programming problem I couldn't Google, or brute-force with a satisfying solution. I am always learning and applying my knowledge to implement new and unique ideas.
